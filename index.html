    <p> Once a  Dog found a bone in the forest .He held the bone in his mouth as he was crossing a stream ,he looked into the water and saw another dog holding a bone in his mouth .He wanted the other bone also so he barked at the dog as he opened his mouth to bark ,the bone fell into the water .He lost the bone it was not another dog in the water it was his own reflection .A greedy Dog had learnt a lesson.</p>
    <p>Moral:
        We should not be greedy
